# Truss-Us
Truss Us builds virtual truss members and calculates the internal reaction forces along with the reaction forces on the pins and rollers. It then displays the trusses, forces, and pins and rollers. The plot allows students to get used to seeing how to find if the member is in tension or compression because the members in tension are in blue and the members in compression are in red.
