# Truss-Us
Truss Us builds virtual truss members and calculates the internal reaction forces along with the reaction forces on the pins and rollers. It then displays the trusses, forces, and pins and rollers. The plot allows students to get used to seeing how to find if the member is in tension or compression because the members in tension are in blue and the members in compression are in red.
 Motivation: As a group of mechanical engineers we know that when calculating the internal forces of static trusses, the hardest part is keeping the signs correct. If students are comfortable determining if a beam is in compression and tension by just looking at the structure, then they will be able to double check their signs and just change if needed.
How to use: Run the code and follow the prompts in the command window. We recommend first draw a truss out on a piece of paper because it will be easier to analyze.
